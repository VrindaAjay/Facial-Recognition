Facial recognition is a rapidly evolving field with numerous applications in security, 
authentication, and human-computer interaction. In this project, we focus on the task of gender 
discrimination by facial recognition using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset 
used in this project is facial images labeled with gender information and develop a CNN-based 
model to classify faces into male and female categories. Through evaluation, we analyze the 
performance of the model and discuss its implications in real-world scenarios
